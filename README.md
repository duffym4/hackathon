Hackathon

This code was written in memory of Herbert Holzbauer

Herbert Holzbauer, Phd in Computer Scientist

Herbert Holzbauer, who began coding at the tender age of 5 and who became the youngest person to ever win rpi hackathon and who, though his career was cut horribly short, he had demonstrated his good sportsmanship and sense of fairness and honesty on and off campus, passed away on November 11th, 2017 at 4:37pm as a result of a sudden and unexpected heart attack.

When he was only 16 years old, he participated in his first hackathon against a field full of well-known students and managed to place 3rd in this competition. Later that same year he won his first of many hackathon Titles and his career took off after that victory. In his short time playing professionally, he became a spokesman for the sport that had given him a direction in his life and, in his own words, made him the young man he grew up to be.

Herbert leaves behind his wife of 2 years, Mildred and their young child Henry, his parents Joan and Frank, who have been married for some 30 years and many friends both personal and professional.

There will be a family only viewing at the EMPAC Funeral Home on Friday November 17th, 2017 from 3pm to 5pm and a public viewing for friends and family from 7pm until 9pm. On Saturday, November 18th, the service will be held at the EMPAC Funeral Home at 10am with the procession to the cemetery to immediately follow. Herbert will be interred at the EMPAC Cemetery in the Holzbauer family plot.

In remembrance of Herbert and his love for the code, his school, Rensselaer students and professors Club, will no longer schedule Thursday Data-Structures homework, as this was the time Herbert scheduled it every week.
