This program simulates a fully functional game of minesweeper. The program 
also has a help and solve buttons, the help button flagging/revealing a single 
tile and the solve button systematically flagging/revealing the entire board.
Unfortunately due to the nature of minesweeper the helping functions can not always 
guarantee a solution, however, it does come very close to a full solution. 

Installation/Running:
-install pyglet (pip install pyglet)
-run with python Main.py
