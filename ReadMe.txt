This program simulates a fully functional game of minesweeper. The program 
also has a help and solve buttons, the help button flagging/revealing a single 
tile and the solve button flagging/revealing the entire board. Unfortunately 
due to the nature of minesweeper the helping functions can not always 
guarantee a solution, however, it does come very close to a full solution.
